# Online Sales Data Analysis – SQL Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze and extract insights from an **Online Sales** dataset.  
It covers querying techniques such as filtering, aggregation, sorting, and grouping to generate meaningful business insights.  
The work includes the original dataset, SQL queries, and documented results.

## Files Included
- **Online_Sales_Data.xlsx** – The raw dataset containing sales transactions, product details, customer information, and revenue data.
- **Online_Sales_Query.sql** – A collection of SQL queries designed to analyze the dataset.
- **Online_Sales_Result_Table.pdf** – Screenshots of the executed query outputs for documentation and reference.

## Process Summary
1. Imported the dataset into a database environment.
2. Analyzed the dataset structure and identified key columns.
3. Wrote SQL queries for:
   - Data filtering based on specific criteria.
   - Calculating aggregates such as total revenue.
   - Grouping and sorting results for insights.
4. Executed queries and verified results.
5. Compiled output screenshots into a PDF for submission.

This project was created as part of an SQL learning and practice exercise to strengthen database querying skills and understand sales data analysis.
